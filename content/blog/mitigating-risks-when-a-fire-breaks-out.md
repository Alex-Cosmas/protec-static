This post comes barely a day after the 20th Century inferno where property worth millions of shillings was in the verge of being reduced to ashes.

So how does an organization ensure that gaps are closed amongst its employees? 

First, when conducting safety training needs assessment for your organisation, it’s important to think about it factoring the different levels of your organisation. Not only will this make it easier to implement, but it will also ensure that vital information is not missed along the way.

There are various ways of doing this,

## **Company-Wide Training**

There are some skills that everyone in your company must possess. This could be essentials like fire safety training and knowing what to do in the event of an evacuation, or how the use the specific equipment to mitigate potential risk.

While most of training needs are based on the department or job role that a person belongs to, we don’t advocate taking short cuts due to cost implications. This has proven to cost organizations big. Reiterating, the above statement. "70% of businesses involved in a major fire either do not reopen, or subsequently fail within 3 years of the fire."

## Management Team

It is important that companies conduct training for their entire staff.  To ensure that standards are maintained, there may be need to set systems and procedure within each department. Consider this a top down approach where the leaders are equipped and skills is transferred across departments depending on the level of management, such as a department manager or a team leader

## By Department

Depending on how your company is structured, you might need to think about the training needs for each department needs. Each department can be broken down into the further job roles. The advantages of approaching training from a department’s perspective guarantees that all your departments are well informed and at the top of their game with it comes to safety matters.

## By Job Role

This approach takes a bit longer as chances of employees have lots of different job duties within the company and finding the right fit needs personal assessment and fit. There is nothing worse as having wrong responsible person for the job.

The best approach has been to appointing a representative with different skills and tasks for each specific job role and making ensuring that the under go through an assessment such as NEBOSH or IOSH guarantees that the candidate is a good fit for the role.

## Onboarding New Staff

This may be one of the most important levels of the whole process that most organizations neglect because it is usually not a top priority. An organization that creates an onboarding plan for new team members are more likely to mitigate risk than an organization that doesn’t.

If there is anything to leave you with is to always remember that, "Safety always begins with proper knowledge."
